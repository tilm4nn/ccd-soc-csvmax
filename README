CCD Training - Separation of Concerns - Event Sender

This project contains the class CsvMaxValuesCalculator that can be used to
determine the max values of a CSV file containing integer values.

The code is difficult to read and difficult to test because it mixes up the
concerns: user interface, file io, file parsing, logging, errorhandling and
business logic.

Goal:
Refactor the class that the concerns are handled technically seperate where
feasible but at least visually seperate in other cases.
